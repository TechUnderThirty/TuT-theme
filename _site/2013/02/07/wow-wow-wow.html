			<p>So much awesomeness has happened in our first month. We’re so happy to say that, so far, Tech Under Thirty is doing very well! Our first event was a lot of fun; we met a lot of cool, smart, intelligent people. A recap will be posted soon with some photos and a rundown of what went on. We learned a lot from you all, and we want to document this process as this group grows with its attendees.</p>

<p>Tonight, we had the venerable Matt Grocki chat with us about Content Strategy via Google+ Hangout. The great thing about Hangouts on Air is that they’re directly <a href="http://youtu.be/MPURBQ0Bc5Q">posted to YouTube</a>! If you happened to miss our first Q&amp;A, feel free to watch it below! Sorry if the intro is a little long; it was our first on-air Hangout and the controls took some getting used to.</p>

<p>Our next event, a hacknight, is now listed on the front page! We’re looking forward to seeing you there. Stay awesome, everyone!</p>
