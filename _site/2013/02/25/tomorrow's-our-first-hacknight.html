			<p>We’re so stoked to run our first hacknight tomorrow. It’s going to be a nice crowd hanging out, chatting, coding, and designing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a coding noob or a pro, you’re invited to come hang out. We’re going work for a few hours, then have a little show and tell (it’s not mandatory, don’t worry!). We’ll have drinks and food, so come hungry!</p>

<p>Not registered for the event yet? It’s $5, and tickets are available until the event begins. Join us!</p>

<h4>The future</h4>

<p>We’re looking to keep the ball rolling and have a combination of monthly online and in-person events. Our first Google+ hangout with an industry master was very inspiring and we’d love to have more. Know someone who might be interested in giving back to the design &amp; technology community? If you think they’re a good candidate for a short presentation on their field and a Q&amp;A, <a href="http://twitter.com/techunderthirty">tweet us</a> or <a href="/contact">send us an email</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of our next in-person event, we’ve already got a great idea and will announce it very soon. This event is aimed at helping tech people gain life experience.</p>

<p>With that, we’re going to continue preparing for tomorrow. Stay cool, everyone!</p>
