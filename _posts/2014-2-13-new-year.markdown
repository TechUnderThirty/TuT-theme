Hello, world! We apologize for the radio silence over the past several months. Here are some updates regarding Tech Under Thirty and the organizers behind the group.

####New Site Design
Asia, Nicole and I have been working on-and-off on the new site design for several months now. Nicole suggested that we switch to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a small, easy-to-manage platform. I loved that idea, so I spent a few hours porting the WordPress theme to static HTML templates. It was actually pretty easy to do, though we will no longer list events on this site because of the complexity involved. Analytics showed us that people barely check this site for event purposes anyway, so we no longer saw the need to support the feature.

####Transitions and Life Changes
In June of 2013, I switched from the corporate world to the startup one. It was a scary transition, but it's proven to be the best choice for my lifestyle. I've also been making a lot of games, teaching, and trying to [speak more often](http://www.slideshare.net/CattSmall).

Nicole and I worked at the same corporate company. She inspired me to start looking for better opportunities. We now work on the same floor of a coworking space for different startups. She'll be a part of [StartupBus](http://startupbus.com/) North America this year.

Asia left her corporate job to refresh her education via a General Assembly UX Immersion course. She is now working as a freelance Senior Interaction Designer and [in the process of looking for a full-time UX Design job](http://asiahoe.com/).

Dennis also left his corporate job and is a budding indie game developer. He builds games with friends and helped co-found the [Brooklyn Gamery](http://brooklyngamery.com/). Chris is now involved with tech and teaching children full-time, so he is less involved with co-organizing the group.

####February 2014 Event: A Roundtable Discussion
There are so many changes happening in our lives. 4 out of 5 of us decided to leave our corporate jobs for other kinds of working styles. To celebrate this change in the new year, we will be holding a discussion roundtable about the merits of corporate, startup, agency, and freelance working styles. Whether you've had good experiences, bad experiences, or are looking for a job, we want you to join us on February 25th!
