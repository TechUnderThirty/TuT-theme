We’re so stoked to run our first hacknight tomorrow. It’s going to be a nice crowd hanging out, chatting, coding, and designing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a coding noob or a pro, you’re invited to come hang out. We’re going work for a few hours, then have a little show and tell (it’s not mandatory, don’t worry!). We’ll have drinks and food, so come hungry!

Not registered for the event yet? It’s $5, and tickets are available until the event begins. Join us!

####The future
We’re looking to keep the ball rolling and have a combination of monthly online and in-person events. Our first Google+ hangout with an industry master was very inspiring and we’d love to have more. Know someone who might be interested in giving back to the design & technology community? If you think they’re a good candidate for a short presentation on their field and a Q&A, [tweet us](http://twitter.com/techunderthirty) or [send us an email](/contact).

In terms of our next in-person event, we’ve already got a great idea and will announce it very soon. This event is aimed at helping tech people gain life experience.

With that, we’re going to continue preparing for tomorrow. Stay cool, everyone!
