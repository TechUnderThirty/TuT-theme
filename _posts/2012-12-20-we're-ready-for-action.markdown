Please [like our Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/techunderthirty) and answer the question if you’re interested in attending an event. We’d love to meet you!  If you’re not into Facebook, we’ve got a [Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/106271289467655027729/posts) and a [Twitter feed](http://www.twitter.com/techunderthirty) going, too.
