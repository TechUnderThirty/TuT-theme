Hey everyone! Here's the compilation of answers from our December Meetup with Lou Rosenfeld. We had around 30 attendees from different backgrounds including UX, IA, and Product Management.

**About Lou Rosenfeld:** Lou consults on information architecture strategy and manages [Rosenfeld Media](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/), which publishes user experience books and provides UX training and consulting. He has also written articles for web technology blogs such as [Smashing Magazine](http://smashingmagazine.com) and [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/). He has been instrumental in helping establish the fields of information architecture and user experience, and in articulating the role and value of librarianship within those fields.

- **Q1: What advice would you give to newcomers in the field?** Be knowledgeable about people, feature design, and how to design in context. "You can't be everything," Lou said, but you should be a generalist where it matters and a specialist in at least one skill.

- **Q2: Is there a good way for a UX designer to think about IA without getting lost?** "IA is about finding. It's not about hierarchy, it's about helping people find things." You can get lost in IA. Data can help to surface the most important content that you should focus on designing. ["Stop Redesigning And Start Tuning Your Site Instead"](http://t.co/1YLVpl8Gi2) is a must-read on prioritizing features and content during a redesign. Usability testing can help to prevent the need for a redesign every 2 years.

- **Q3: How do you help people find things when they don't know what they're looking for?** Create contextual navigation. Your landing page is important, but so is contextual navigation for those who arrive from search websites. You can automate contextual navigation via logic and metadata. Destroy the content silos.

- **Q4: How can I figure out what people want?** Figure out the business goals. What are you measuring and why? Step back and think about the most important data, then diagnose design problems.

- **Q5: What's next in UX and IA?** It's up to you. Find your niche and build your own path. If you find yourself doing things that no one else will, you have a great opportunity to do something new. Each time a new branch of UX is discovered, it is integrated into common practice. As IA and UX evolves, generalism increases. 

- **Q6: How do you stay fresh in the publishing industry?** Don't get stuck in success. "Success can tie you down."

- **Q7: With the market for designers getting wider, what do you think about the future of the UX industry?** We will have senior role UXers. CXOs, even. This generation is lucky because they're natural synthesists, constantly evolving. Cross-pollination is growing in UX design. Designers are taking knowledge from other fields and improving the practice.

- **Q8: Real estate is critical. Is responsive design the best solution?** Not always. Apps have appropriate use cases.

- **Q9: Will we start to see more UX curriculums in schools?** Change is hard in academics. Much learning may need to be done through self-study. Go to lectures, learn online. There are many books you can buy, including Don't Make Me Think, Gamestorming, UX Team of One, and Elements of User Experience. People into HCI, UX, and neuroscience should check out Susan Weinschenk's books.

- **Q10: How do I make a good UX portfolio?** Your portfolio isn't the product. You are. Sell yourself through words AND presentation. Tell a story in your work.

If you have any questions for Lou, he has [a Twitter](https://twitter.com/louisrosenfeld) and organizes the [Brooklyn UX meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Brooklyn-UX/). We hope to see you at our [February event about workplaces and working styles](http://www.meetup.com/TechUnderThirty/events/163252902/)!
