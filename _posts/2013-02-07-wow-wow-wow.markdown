So much awesomeness has happened in our first month. We’re so happy to say that, so far, Tech Under Thirty is doing very well! Our first event was a lot of fun; we met a lot of cool, smart, intelligent people. A recap will be posted soon with some photos and a rundown of what went on. We learned a lot from you all, and we want to document this process as this group grows with its attendees.

Tonight, we had the venerable Matt Grocki chat with us about Content Strategy via Google+ Hangout. The great thing about Hangouts on Air is that they’re directly [posted to YouTube](http://youtu.be/MPURBQ0Bc5Q)! If you happened to miss our first Q&A, feel free to watch it below! Sorry if the intro is a little long; it was our first on-air Hangout and the controls took some getting used to.

Our next event, a hacknight, is now listed on the front page! We’re looking forward to seeing you there. Stay awesome, everyone!
