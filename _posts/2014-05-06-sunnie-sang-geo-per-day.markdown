Hey y'all! It's been a bit since the last blog post, so here's an update.

Our April event was amazing. Sunnie Sang, an entrepreneur and MFA Interaction Design candidate at School of Visual Arts, talked to the group about her experience with building her own business, leveraging social media networks to gain followers, dealing with the highs and lows of entrepreneurship, and self-management.

**About Sunnie Sang:** In February 2014, Sunnie started an entrepreneurial design project with a [blogazine](http://geoperday.tumblr.com/) and geometry-inspired Etsy store called [GEO Design Store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/GEOPERDAY?ref=l2-shopheader-name). Through the project, Sunnie learned a lot about about entrepreneurship, social media marketing, and her own strength.

Here are some inspiring points from the event:

- **Use social media to your advantage and see what gives you the best returns.** Sunnie tried to create communities on both Tumblr and Instagram, but Instagram was more effective for gaining a potential customer following.
- **Don't settle on your first idea; see what's most cost-effective for your budget.** Sunnie's first iteration of a product, printed fabric, took too long to make. She continued iterating and eventually decided on posters because they're easy to design, print, and ship. She later plans to expand her offerings to include some of her more expensive ideas.
- **Keep yourself motivated with visual inspiration.** It's easy to lose focus when no one's hounding you with deadlines or requirements. Mood boards and product goals can help keep you on track.
- **Set small goals to continually make progress.** Small chunks of work feel easier to accomplish than large buckets. Your project will seem more possible if you break it into separate tasks.
- **Frequently check in with your emotions and reward yourself.** Becoming an entrepreneur can be demoralizing, so make sure you don't fall in too deep. Give yourself treats for finishing important tasks and passing milestones.
- **Reach out to others for feedback.** Your customers and network can help you create a better product. Listen to their opinions and treat them with respect. You never know what could happen -- someone might feature your product or want to collaborate with you!
- **Gauge interest for your product via your social media networks.**  After a photo of the first GEO/DAY poster was shared on Instagram, people asked where they could buy it. Sunnie immediately opened an Etsy store to sell the poster; the first sale was international.
- **Believe in yourself and don't get hung up on things.** Trust your intuition and passion. Get out of your head, start and act. Embrace uncertainty and imperfection.
- **The connection between people is awesome.**
When you do what you enjoy, people will gather around you and support you.
- **Start your serious side project now.** You can take risks and still get paid. Devote time after your 40 hours a week to something you enjoy doing. Don't let your creativity die, and don't think you need to lose your paycheck to become an entrepreneur.


People came away from Sunnie's talk incredibly inspired. I hope the lessons she learned have inspired you, too! If you'd like to see the full talk, you can [watch it on YouTube](http://youtu.be/6DlUwKF51qQ).

Stay awesome!
