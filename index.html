				<p>Tech Under Thirty is a new group for designers &amp; tech-oriented people under the age of thirty. If you’re a game developer, a web designer, a print designer, an engineer, blogger, or anything in between, we’re interested in meeting you.</p>
				<p>Tech Under Thirty’s purpose is to give young people in design and technology fields a chance to branch out amongst their peers. Students and those interested in getting into design &amp; tech-related fields are welcome to join us. No experience required!</p>
